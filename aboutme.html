            <p.tab class="am">From the time I was a small child there have been two things that
               have defined me: <strong>curiosity</strong> and <strong>passion</strong>. I’ve always been very curious,
                curious about people, other cultures, puzzles, how things work, you
                 name it, I’ve probably spent some time pondering or researching it.
                  This curiosity has led me to travel to many foreign lands, learn
                   other languages, try new things I thought I would never get to
                    try and of course led me to meet some amazing people along the way.</p>
            <p.tab class="am">I’ve also also been very passionate. When I was a kid and even today
               I had a very strong passion for sports, I lived for the weekend playing
                games and competing against other kids. I have also found new passions,
                 a passion for language which has led me to become fluent in spanish;
                  a passion to help people, which has led me to volunteer in developing
                   countries; and a passion for life, no matter how hard the day is
                    just trying to stay positive and find the little moments of joy.</p>
